      I have always been a computer nerd at heart. Growing up, I worked through every computing book I could get my hands on, and I still find myself experimenting with new technology and code late at night. Mathematics and programming were always interesting (and still are) to me, but I found applying my skills to biology immensely rewarding. I began pursuing a PhD in bioinformatics at Indiana University, but life took me to Austin, Texas mid-degree. While writing my dissertation remotely, I keep myself busy and current as a research scientist at <a href="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu">The Texas Advanced Computing Center</a> at UT Austin.

      I work to develop and deploy scalable and usable tools at on TACC, XSEDE, and CyVerse resources and the Plant Genome Research Projects I contribute to. While working at TACC, I have also found that I also enjoy teaching as well. I helped found and teach the <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/education/stem-programs/code-at-tacc/wearables-camp">CODE@TACC</a> summer camp with the help from my colleagues. I also volunteer for <a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/fri/community/k-12-students-teachers/164-freshman-research-initiative/outreach/633-shadow-a-scientist-program">Shadow a Scientist</a> and other outreach programs taking place at TACC. Most recently, I had the privilege to help teach educators from around the country at <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/picademy/">Picademy.</a>
