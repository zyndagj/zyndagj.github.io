			I entered the bioinformatics and high-performance computing world in 2010. This was a great time, since next generation sequencing was becoming affordable and Perl was going out of fashion. My data is usually larger than system memory, so I have learned to be deliberate with my choice of methods to minimize bottlenecks. Most of my time is spent developing new algorithms, distributed workflows, and intuitive visualisations for omics-centered research. I am passionate about accessible computing, such as well-designed software or new technologies to empower small shops to answer big questions. I enjoy approaching development, in vim (the correct editor), with an end-user in mind: neither the installation nor usage should be cumbersome, the documentation should be exemplary, and figures should be generated as a guide to the results.
